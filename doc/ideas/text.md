# Text & Typography Effects

Scrollers and text-based effects - essential demoscene elements.

## Classic Scrollers

**Types:**
- **Horizontal scroller** - text slides left/right
- **Vertical scroller** (credits roll)
- **Sine scroller** - each character follows sine wave vertically
- **DYCP** (Different Y Character Position) - characters at varying heights
- **Elastic/rubber scroller** - text stretches and bounces

**Region interaction:** Each region displays independent message.

## Typewriter

Character-by-character text reveal.

**Variations:**
- Cursor blink
- Random character scramble before settling
- Sound effect sync (click per character)

## Shattered Text

Text explodes into pieces, then reassembles.

**How it works:**
- Render text to buffer
- Break into fragments (per-character or per-pixel chunks)
- Apply physics (explosion outward)
- Reverse to reassemble

**Region interaction:** Each letter lands in a different region.

## Greetings Cascade

Classic demo tradition - shout-outs to other groups.

**How it works:**
- Text appears in one region
- Transitions to next region
- Each region lights up as text passes through

## Rasterbars Behind Text

Colored bars scrolling behind static or moving text.

**Combination of two classics for layered effect.**

## Dot Matrix Text

Text rendered as grid of animated dots.

**Variations:**
- Dots fade in/out
- Wave propagation through dots
- 3D dot rotation

## Character Rain (Matrix-style)

Falling characters creating vertical streams.

**How it works:**
- Columns of random characters falling
- Head of stream is bright, tail fades
- Occasional character changes mid-fall

## Big Sprite Letters

Oversized pixel art characters that animate.

**Variations:**
- Bouncing letters
- Letters with faces/expressions
- Letters that morph between words

## Writer Credits

Structured credit rolls with effects.

**Elements:**
- Role/name pairs
- Logo appearances
- Transition effects between sections
